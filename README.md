PicEditor
=========

This is the revolutionary Picnik photo editor with all branding removed, open sourced with the Apache 2.0 license.

Google released the source to Picnik earlier this year (http://code.google.com/p/piceditor/) but people have had trouble finding it. My Picnik co-founder [Mike Harrington](https://github.com/mikehar) and I would love to see more people benefit from the tremendous effort and care the Picnik Team poured into it so here's a clone for you to work from. There's a lot of cool stuff in there.

We're not able to provide any kind of support but did port over the instructions for building and running PicEditor. Enjoy!
